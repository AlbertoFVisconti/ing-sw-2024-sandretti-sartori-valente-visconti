/**
 *  ItemCollection is class that allows to store information about amounts of items.
 *  With item we intend every object of the Corner enum class, except {@code Corner.EMPTY}, which represents
 *  the concept of "missing item", counting this kind of Corner is not useful nor reasonable for this application.
 *  The class allows the user to perform set operations with ItemCollection and Corner types.
 *  Storing capabilities become particularly useful when dealing with players' inventories or
 *  cards' resource constraint and when moving amounts of items around (collecting resources from placed cards for instance).
 *  Set operations allow goals and scoring evaluation methods to become simple to write, read and understand.
 *  <p>
 *  Example:
 *  <pre>{@code
 *  // Creating a new empty ItemCollection
 *  ItemCollection collection = new ItemCollection();
 *
 *  // Adding 3 PLANTs, 1 ANIMAL and 2 FEATHERS to the ItemCollection
 *  collection.add(Corner.PLANT, 3)
 *            .add(Corner.ANIMAL)
 *            .add(Corner.FEATHER, 2);
 *
 *  // Asking the ItemCollection how many PLANTs were stored (3)
 *  int plantCount = collection.count(Corner.PLANT);
 *
 *  // Removing 2 PLANTs and 1 ANIMAL from the ItemCollection
 *  collection.sub(Corner.PLANT, 2)
 *            .sub(Corner.ANIMAL);
 *  }</pre>
